# Track My Cash
This website is for people who use credit cards often.

When a purchase is made on a credit card, the money is not removed from your bank account right away. First, the payment must take it's time to process, and then you can pay it off using your bank account. Unless you do the math and keep a log of every purchase you make with your credit cards, it's hard to know how much money you really have. Your bank account could say $1000 but have $250 on your credit card statement. 

This website is the tool you need to keep track of how much money you really have.

After each purchase, you can manually log the amount of money you spent and it will automatically show you how much money you actually have left in your account.
